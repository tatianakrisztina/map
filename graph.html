      <p>As you can see on the map above, the South Bronx has some of the least amount of trees in the borough. Trees are needed in the Bronx not only to make a space more beautiful, but they help the environment as well. </p>
<p>“The South Bronx is basically boarded by all highways; you have the cross Bronx, you have the Deegan, you have the Bruckner, air pollution there is so bad,” said Jen Seda, a conservation crew member for the Bronx River Alliance. </p>
      <p>According to Jill Jonnes, the author of Urban Forests: A Natural History of Trees and People in the American Cityscape, one tree can absorb 1.7 pounds of pollution a year. </p>
    <p>“I can tell you that the worst asthma in New York is in the Bronx,” said Jonnes. </p>
  <p>The Bronx River Alliance is trying to make the area better for the community by hosting tree planting events in the Bronx, like the one they held on December 1, 2021 in Rosewood Park. Over 150 trees were planted, and the number of trees in the Bronx will increase. This will lead to better air quality for the neighborhood, and create a happier environment.  </p>
